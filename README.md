# map_animation
Android animation on GoogleMap  between 2 points. Arrow is animated from one location to the other.
We get the  input from the user for the 2 locations.
Now to draw animate the arrow moving from the FromLocation to ToLocation we need these below things:

a. Latitude and Lontitudes of all the points which lie in between these 2 points.

b. Rotation for the arrow accordingly.

Using these 2 points, we animate the arrow between the 2 points.
Here the arrow is represented on the map using another marker, whose location(position) keepc changing to show an animating effect.
